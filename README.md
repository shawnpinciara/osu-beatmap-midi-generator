# Osu Beatmap Midi Generetor
## Idea:
The process of making [OSU!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) beatmaps is really hard ant time consuming, plus there are really a few beatmap makers compered to the community who play the game.
So usually many songs don't have beatmaps, or they arrive years later the song was published.

Many people before have tried to use ML learning to generate beatmaps, but I think this approach is wrong from the beginning as the perception of rhythm is really personal and hard to replicate. That's why i think we still need a human input for the process.

## Proposition:
The human record a MIDI track pressing buttons on time with the song, grooving and feeling the rhythm with his own style.
Later the MIDI track is converted, so the time of the midi notes are translated to the time of the OSU's circles to click in game.
The circle's position on the screen are though generated, the method for this part is not defined yet.

## Structure:
This tool should be used by anyone, so I thought a simple python script can fit the project.

## Updates:
- 09/07/23: the project has been developed again changing language (Python)
- 22/01/22: The project is pushed on Github, consist on only a blank page with some buttons
